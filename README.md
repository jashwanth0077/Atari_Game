## Atari_Game

Welcome to my repository showcasing a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent designed to tackle Atari games, specifically focusing on mastering the classic CartPole-v1 environment. This project dives into the realm of reinforcement learning, aiming to teach an agent optimal strategies through interaction with its environment.

#What is Deep Q-Learning?
Deep Q-Learning (DQN) is a powerful technique in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly well-suited for environments where actions influence future states and rewards. At its core, DQN learns to make decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards over time, leveraging a neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function.

#Why CartPole-v1?
CartPole-v1 serves as an ideal starting point for understanding DQN due to its simplicity and clear termination conditions. By mastering this environment, the DQN agent learns fundamental concepts such as state representation, action selection, reward optimization, and policy improvement.
